SENTENCE-LEVEL FENCING:
    when next buffer token is <eos>, force reduce until |s| = 1, then step sentence-level model to provide next sentence-level

NO FENCING:
    provide some sort of incentive to reduce shifts/increase reduces, roughly proportional to log |s|

every reduce:
    zl, zr -> zp
    zl -> ~zp
    ~zp -> ~A, ~X
    minimize ~A <> A, ~X <> X
